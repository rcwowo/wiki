# Origins
Dhinkha is a magical [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer) that was born [172 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age), originating from an expansive [forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest) in an alternative realm. For 144 years, the deer roamed and [vibed](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vibe), living in harmony with [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment). Until one faithful day, when they discovered a unique looking [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle) emitting a bright hue. [Mana crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(game_terminology\)), maintaining their capacity through the [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment) of the [forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest), appeared to power or charge the magic circle.

Curious, Dhinkha made the [decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought) to approach the magical [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle). Upon it’s [touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system), the [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer) began to change. A transformation that took on the same appearance as one you would see when watching a [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_\(video_game_series\)#Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution) evolve would begin to take place. The [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer) started to morph and take on a [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid)-like shape, while still keeping it’s [antlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antler).

While not [permanent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/permanent), the magic [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle) had casted a spell on Dhinkha; causing them to take on a [human-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid) appearance. The spell would slowly deteriorate and wear off over time, causing Dhinkha to eventually return to their regular magic [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer) shape.
# Present Day
Dhinkha would begin to enjoy their “new” [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_\(biology\)) and continued to maintain it for the past 28 years since that faithful day.

And while they currently occupy the planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth); they would need to return to their home realm every 5 years to maintain their shape. The [mana crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(game_terminology\)), dependent on the [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment) of the [forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest), would always be recharged and ready - and more could always be provided if necessary.
