## Topic 1 - The culture war brewing from political violence.

### Summary:
During the last morning show, we discussed the assassination of the political commentator and co-founder of the PAC, Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk during a “debate me” style event at Utah Valley University. Following this, it sparked many discussions regarding the morality of celebration or condemnation of his death, and political violence in general.

Since then, a lot more has unfolded. So I’ll do my best to recap for anybody that cares.

During the 33-hour long manhunt, media outlets and other authorities consistently gave out inconsistent or outright false and dangerous information. Political affiliation, gender identity, race, etc. were used as a means to convey the identity of the supposed culprit.

Crime scene investigators found several bullets, one fired, and three others unfired containing writings etched into the casings:

* The fired bullet reads “Notices buldges OWO what’s this?” - a nod to the notorious furry copypasta and somehow creating a link between Senzawa and the assassination of Charlie Kirk.
* The other bullets read:
  * “Hey fascist! Catch!” with symbols of an up arrow, a right arrow, and three down arrows. Which is a stratagem code in Helldivers 2 to launch the Eagle 500kg Bomb.
  * “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao” which is likely a reference to “Bella Ciao” - a song dedicated to the Italian resistance against Nazi troops during World War II.
  * The final bullet reads “If you read this you are gay LMAO.” Gottem.

In a press conference, Utah governor Spencer Cox said that he had prayed that the shooter “wouldn’t be one of us.” saying:

> “For 33 hours, I was praying that if this had to happen here that it wouldn't be one of us — that somebody drove from another state, somebody came from another country… Sadly, that prayer was not answered the way I hoped for…”

While a motive still hasn’t been clearly found, the currently suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson was arrested and held without bail on suspicion of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and discharge of a weapon causing serious bodily harm.

As information currently stands, he was raised in a largely conservative area, with most of his family being comprised of registered republicans. He however, is registered as unaffiliated. Investigators also found that Robinson had been living with someone who I personally will describe as a roommate, as romantic interests have not been confirmed, whom allegedly is a or is a transitioning transgender M2F woman who is cooperating with authorities.

The assassination has seen MANY varied responses, with our beloved United States President, Donald Trump, blaming “the radical left” and vowing to go after “each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity.” to Republican senator, John Curtis saying that “If it were up to me, I think you need to take the word ‘radical’ and remove ‘right’ or ‘left,’” adding that “Radical coming from any direction is not good, it’s not healthy and it should be called out.”

## Topic 2 - What a completely normal and rational thing to say.
### Sources:
- <https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/14/business/brian-kilmeade-fox-news-apology-homeless>
### Summary:
Back on Wednesday, September 10th, Fox News morning host Brian Kilmeade, made a statement that received much backlash.

During a “Fox & Friends” segment discussing the murder of Ukrainian refugee **Iryna Zarutska** in Charlotte, North Carolina. To provide context, Zarutska was fatally stabbed by a man with history of mental illness and multiple felony convictions whilst riding the Blue Line train. Charlotte Mayor, Vi Lyles blamed the killings on failures within the court system that allowed Brown to re-enter the community despite his history.

During this discussion, Kilmaede would eventually interject. This is an excerpt directly from the CNN article:

> Co-host Lawrence Jones said taxpayers have given “billions of dollars to mental health and the homeless population,” but “a lot of them don’t want to take the programs, a lot of them don’t want to get the help that is necessary.”
>
> “You can’t give them a choice,” Jones continued. “Either you take the resources that we’re going to give you **…** or you decide that you are going to be locked up in jail. That’s the way it has to be now.”
>
> That’s what prompted Kilmeade to add, “Or involuntary lethal injection or something. Just kill ‘em.”

Following the clip garnering attention, Kilmeade apologized during yesterday’s “Fox & Friends Weekend” show. Saying that:

> “we were discussing the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte and how to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalizing or jailing such people so they cannot attack again”

> “Now during that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections, I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.

Wonderful reporting from the entertainment ***and not*** journalism company, Fox News.

### Summary:
During the last morning show, Nintendo held their tried and true Nintendo Direct. I was obviously live during this, so I didn’t get to see what they announced. So here’s everything that was announced during the event:

* **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** was announced. It is still being produced in collaboration with Illumination and will probably be just as successful as the other movie. Get back to me once they bring back the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.
* Similarly, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 as just **“Super Mario Galaxy”** with both titles receiving improved UI and alternative control methods, an in-game music player, new storybook content, and enhanced resolution. Switch 2 users will supposedly be able to play the game in 4K. Releasing on October 2nd.
* For fans of the Metroid series, Samus makes her long awaited return in **Metroid Prime 4: Beyond**, releasing on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4th.
* **Pokémon Pokopia** is a new “Animal Crossing” style Pokémon game where you play as a humanoid Ditto to “shape an empty land into a beautiful space for a variety of Pokémon.” Preorders begin on November 12th.
* **Donkey Kong Bananza** receives it’s first paid DLC titled **“DK Island & Emerald Rush.**” The expansion brings Donkey Kong and Pauline to DK Island, as well as adding post main game story content with Void Kong offering you a position in Void Company collecting as much emerald ore as you can in Emerald Rush. The DLC is available now on the eShop.
* **Pokémon Legends: Z-A** and the paid **Mega Dimension DLC** are releasing the same day on October 16th.  I don’t know enough about new Pokémon games to tell you what the game is about this time around, but the Mega Dimension DLC will continue your adventure in Lumiose City with mysterious distortions appearing without warning.
* **Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment** - the hoard battling Zelda game, releases on Nov 6.
* **Super Mario Bros. Wonder** receives an update for Switch 2 featuring multiplayer gameplay. Titled “Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park” the new update features both cooperative and competitive game modes. It launches on Switch 2 in spring of 2026.
* **Yoshi and the Mysterious Book** is a new Yoshi game releasing in spring 2026. On the island where Yoshi and his friends live, a peculiar talking book named Mr. E suddenly falls from the sky. This mysterious book’s pages contain information about unusual creatures, so Yoshi decides to jump in and help investigate.
* **Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream**, the long awaited sequel to the Tomodachi Life 3DS game is releasing in spring of 2026.
* Virtual Boy is the newest Switch Online emulation thing. You will need to buy the accessory or cardboard alternative needed to play through the My Nintendo Store. Releases for online + expansion pack members on February 17th of 2026.
* Mario Tennis Fever is a Mario tennis game that releases on February 12th of 2026.

That’s all the announcements that I think anyone will care about. If you’re interested in more, check out the September 12th Nintendo Direct for yourself.

## Topic 4 - Thought you could escape AI this episode? Nope.
### Sources:

### Summary:
I’ll keep this one short and sweet cause we get the point. I just really want to drive home that I’m praying on AI’s downfall.

Penske Media Corporation, the parent company of both The Rolling Stone magazine and The Hollywood Reporter has become one of the first major media companies to sue Google for it’s AI summaries.

I wish them the best of luck.

## Topic 5 - Windows 10 is on death row, unless you do this…
### Sources:
- <https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/microsoft-offers-windows-10-extended-security-updates-for-free-you-just-need-to-do-one-thing/>

### Summary:
If you did or didn’t know, Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 on October 14th of this year. Meaning if you are still using the operating system, you have less than a month to jump ship to Windows 11.

However, you still have some options. If you want to stay on Windows 10 for at least another year, you can do one of the following:

* Pay Microsoft $30 for the Extended Security Updates program. This will allow your computer to receive security updates for another year. Enterprise customers will be given options to purchase up to three more years of security updates.
* Using 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, you can redeem a year of security updates. Yes, you’re hearing that right. By simply subjecting yourself to data collection and being forced to use Bing, you can squeeze another year out of Windows 10.
* And for what is the weirdest and most simple way to get another year of updates, if you enable the Windows Backup app with OneDrive. This comes with the drawback that you only get 5GB of storage with OneDrive on it’s base tier.

Of course there are other options if you’re still on Windows 10. If your computer doesn’t meet the system requirements of Windows 11, you can use a tool like Rufus to remove the system requirements and install Windows 11 regardless.

Or, you can venture into the choice paralysis of Linux distros. But I doubt it.
