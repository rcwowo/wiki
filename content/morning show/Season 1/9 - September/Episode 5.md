### Summary:
Florida, often considered it’s own country within the United States and home to many “Florida men” announced that it intends to cancel any and all of their vaccine mandates - most of which are targeted at school children. In all U.S. states, while mandates can vary, require a vaccination of some kind in order to attend a public school.

Florida’s top health official, Joseph Ladapo compared the vaccination mandates to that of “slavery” and further defended the decision by saying “Who am I to tell you what your child should put in your body? I don’t have that right. Your body is a gift from God.”

While no exact timeline was specified, this would end mandates for multiple vaccinations against diseases like chicken pox, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, and polio.

This, of course, follows U.S. Health Secretary RFK Jr, and his continuous doubts against vaccinations. Often claiming them to be the cause of autism despite mass amounts of research suggesting otherwise.

Sextortion-based hacking, which is when an attacker hijacks a victim’s webcam or socially engineers them into releasing nude photography or films in an attempt to blackmail them, is nothing new.

## Topic 7 - Instagram has an actual iPad app now. But…
### Sources:
- <https://www.theverge.com/news/769460/instagram-ipad-app-launch-reels>
### Summary:
For users of both the Meta-owned platform, and users of iPadOS devices, Instagram will finally be receiving a dedicated app for the iPad, and later to Android tablets.

Previously, the app for iPads simply displayed an upscaled version of the iOS app, complete with letterboxing and unused screen real estate.

The new version of the app, will better utilize all of the space provided by the tablet, and contains all of the features of their phone counterpart apps. The most notable difference, however, is that the iPad app will open directly to reels, instead of your regular photo feed.

Instagram has long been attempting to overtake the short-form video platform, TikTok, especially following the “will they, won’t they” regarding the United States ban on the Chinese-based app. Many speculate that this is an attempt to pivot away from what was once the square shaped photo sharing app, into a monetizable, short formed video platform.
